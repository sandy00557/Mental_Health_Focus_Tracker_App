  /*Why do we need <Provider store={store}> for useSelector and useDispatch to work?

Because all state in Redux lives inside the store, and useSelector and useDispatch are hooks from react-redux that rely on accessing that store through React Context.

üîå Here's What Happens Without <Provider>:
useSelector() can't access the state

useDispatch() can't dispatch actions

Neither hook can subscribe to the store

So it throws an error:

‚ùå "Could not find react-redux context value; please ensure the component is wrapped in a <Provider>"

üîÅ So What Does <Provider> Do?
<Provider store={store}> is like a wiring system that injects the Redux store into the entire React component tree using React Context.

This allows:

useSelector() to read and subscribe to the store

useDispatch() to send actions to the store
